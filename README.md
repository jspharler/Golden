A personal blog WordPress theme design using the golden ratio. 

Page layout of this theme is based on golden ratio proportions.  Sidebar width is scaled to the main content by dividing the main width by 1.618.  The header and title bar follow the same scale.  The author bio is also scaled accordingly.

Using Jetpack, social media icons will appear on posts, with the author info.

Author avatar will appear below post in single view, and in the comment area.

Posts and pages can have Featured Images. On single post, the Featured Image replaces the header image, with the post pulled up into it slightly.  I think this brings focus to the main content, and utilizes available space well.
