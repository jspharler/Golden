Page layout of this theme is based on golden ratio proportions.  Sidebar width is scaled to the main content by dividing the main width by 1.618.  The header and title bar follow the same scale.  The author bio is also scaled accordingly.

Using Jetpack, social media icons will appear on posts, with the author info.

### Gravatar
